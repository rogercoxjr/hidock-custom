## 🔧 Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
python setup.py
# Choose option 2 (Developer)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd apps/desktop
pytest tests/
```

#### Test Markers & Fast vs Full Suite

By default the repository defines markers to classify tests:

- `unit` – fast, pure-Python or lightweight logic
- `integration` – touches external systems, heavier setup
- `gui` – requires a display / GUI toolkits
- `slow` – long-running or large dataset processing

The default invocation (no args) in local dev or CI (fast lane) skips
`integration`, `gui`, and `slow` to keep feedback loops tight.

Fast subset (default behavior via `pytest.ini`):

```bash
pytest -q
```

Run only integration tests:

```bash
pytest -m integration
```

Run full test suite (all markers):

```bash
pytest -m "unit or integration or gui or slow"
```

Or simply clear filtering by overriding `-m`:

```bash
pytest -m ""
```

Run everything including verbose output:

```bash
pytest -vv -m ""
```

Example: run unit + slow (e.g., for a targeted performance check):

```bash
pytest -m "unit or slow"
```

If you maintain custom CI stages, you can mirror this split:

| Stage        | Command                                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| fast (default)| `pytest -q`                            |
| integration  | `pytest -m integration -q`             |
| gui          | `pytest -m gui`                        |
| full         | `pytest -m "unit or integration or gui or slow"` |

Tip: Keep the quick path green before running the heavier suites.

### Building for Distribution

```bash
python scripts/build/build_desktop.py
```

### Virtual Environments

See `docs/VENV.md` for the per-platform virtual environment strategy (separate `.venv.<tag>` per OS/WSL). The runtime scripts (`run-desktop.*`) and setup logic auto-select or create the correct one via `scripts/env/select_venv.py`.

Common setup flags:

```bash
# Non-interactive full developer setup (auto-skip migration unless specified)
python setup.py --non-interactive

# Force legacy migration strategy
python setup.py --migrate=copy      # or --migrate=rebuild / --migrate=skip

# Explicit end-user minimal mode
python setup.py --mode=end-user

# Recreate tagged environment even if it exists
python setup.py --force-new-env

# Diagnose virtual environment only (no installs)
python setup.py --diagnose-venv

# Auto-install missing Debian/Ubuntu system dependencies (tk, ffmpeg, libusb, build tools)
python setup.py --auto-install-missing
```

Environment variable alternative for migration:

```bash
HIDOCK_AUTO_MIGRATE=c python setup.py   # c=copy, r=rebuild, s=skip
```

Environment variable alternative for auto-install (CI / scripted):

```bash
HIDOCK_AUTO_INSTALL_MISSING=1 python setup.py --non-interactive
```

### Linux System Dependencies

On Debian/Ubuntu based systems the setup script can detect and help resolve missing packages:

- python3-tk / python3-dev (Tkinter UI)
- ffmpeg / libavcodec-extra (audio transcoding)
- libusb-1.0-0-dev / libudev-dev / pkg-config (device communications)
- build-essential (compilation toolchain)
- dialout group membership (USB access)

If you see a prompt listing missing dependencies you can:

1. Run the bundled automated installer
2. View manual apt commands
3. Continue anyway (not recommended)

To skip prompts and let the script attempt installation automatically:

```bash
python setup.py --auto-install-missing --non-interactive
```

If packages fail to install you will still be able to continue, but Python dependency installation may later fail until system requirements are met.
